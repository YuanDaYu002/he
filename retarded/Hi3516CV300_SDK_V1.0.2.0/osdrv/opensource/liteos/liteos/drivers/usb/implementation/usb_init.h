Description: initialize the controller of usb,attach the usb protocol
Input: ctype ------the type of usb's controller, the legal value is one of  'controller_type';
                              if it is HOST , 'dtype' can be any value of 'device_type'; if it is DEVICE, 'dtype' must be one of 'device_type' that user needs
          dtype------the type of device, the legal value is one of 'device_type', if 'ctype' is DEVICE, it is determined by the use requirements
Output: None
Return: success is LOS_OK, failure is LOS_NOK
