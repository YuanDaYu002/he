* @par Prototype
* @code
* cchar *inet_ntoa_r(const ip_addr_t addr, char *buf, int buflen)
* @endcode
*
* @par Purpose
* This function is used to convert the IPv4 address from binary notation (network byte order)
* to string notation (number and dot format). This is the reentrant API of inet_ntoa.
*
* @par Description
* This function is used to convert the IPv4 address from binary notation (network byte order)
* to string notation (number and dot format). This is the reentrant API of inet_ntoa. So the
* generated string notation IPv4 address is updated in the user passed buffer.
*
* @param[in]   addr     Binary notation of IPv4 address [N/A]
* @param[out]  buf   Pointer to user buffer, in which the ouput string format of IPv4 address will be updated [N/A]
* @param[in]    buflen  Length of the user buffer [N/A]
*
* @par Return values
*  Valid pointer : On success, returns pointer to buffer passed by user in buf\n
*  NULL : On failure \n
*
* @par Required Header File
* inet.h
*
* @par Note
* 1. This interface is available as only macro.
