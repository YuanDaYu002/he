* int lwip_sntp_start(int server_num, char **sntp_server, struct timeval *time);
* @endcode
*
* @par Purpose
* This API is used to start the SNTP module.
*
* @par Description
* This API is used to start the SNTP query.
*
* @param[in]    server_num   Total servers in param sntp_server [N/A]
* @param[in]    sntp_server  Domain name or IP_add of SNTP server in string format [N/A]
* @param[out]   time         the time of server if lwip_sntp_start return ERR_OK. [N/A]
*
* @par Return values
* ERR_OK On success\n
* ERR_MEM On failure, due to memory error\n
* ERR_ARG On failure, due to incorrect arg\n
* ERR_TIMEOUT On failure, due to sntp server is not response\n
*
* @par Required Header File
* sntp.h
*
* @par Note
* 1. If Input parameter sntp_server passed as NULL or server_num assed as 0 to this API,
* in that case this API will fail with return value ERR_ARG.
* 2. If the string length of sntp_server passed to this API is greater than SNTP_SERVER_ADDR_SIZE
* then this API will fail with return value ERR_ARG.\n
* 3. This API will block for a few seconds waiting for sntp server replay.\n
* 4. If this API return ERR_OK, and param time is not NULL,
* Then time will be the time obtain form sntp server.\n
