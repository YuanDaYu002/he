Known Issues
The following are some known issues with this release.

    * kernel:
      - cpu usage:  The mechanism of cpu usage is different from Linux.

    * fs:
      - yaffs: ylib, a cache between nand driver and yaffs, is turned off by default in this release.
      This is a tradeoff between access speed and nand flash lifetime. Turning on ylib may decrease nand
      flash lifetime because ylib will erase more frequently due to cache update. Add macro
      CONFIG_FS_YAFFS_CACHE to turn on ylib.
